- I'm currently exploring the great ecosystem of NodeJS as a backend developer who migrated from PHP.
- I really enjoy writing tiny helper scripts with Python (the swiss army knife) and I'm currently learning basic AI and Image Processing with it!
- Long ago, I happened to have some experiments with jQuery and Bootstrap for front-end development. I'm planning on learning a front-end framework like React, Angular, Vue etc ... as I feel comfortable with Javascript.
- Recently I fell in love with a great addition to Javascript, the Typescript. I strongly believe that It makes Javascript programming much more easier and safer.
- How about compiled languages? I have had some development experiences with C++, although I didn't like it much and planning on trying out Go and Rust or even migrate back to the old-school C.
- Still wandering for a certain choice as Programming Language to take root with ...
